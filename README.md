# ImageDenoisingProject
Implementation and evaluation of classical and deep learning-based image denoising methods. The project compares Non-Local Means (NLM), BM3D, U-Net, and Denoising Autoencoders under different noise models (Gaussian, Salt &amp; Pepper), using PSNR as the primary performance metric.
